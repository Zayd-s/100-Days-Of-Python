# 100-Python-Projects
100 Days of Full Stack Python course, creating 100 projects using different frameworks
This repo takes from the following Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

In each folder, the final projects are distinguished by a repeated naming convention - "project" followed by a suitable project name
A few projects however, are task based rather than aiming to achieve a final project - These will contain links to the tasks within the folders
